===========
The program should be compileable. 
If glugen-rt-natives-windows something is missing it can be found at http://jogamp.org/, place it in lib. 

I've used the following as aid: 
https://sites.google.com/site/justinscsstuff/jogl-tutorials
and picking.java from jogl official website.
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9hhZie2D-fEZGI2NTZhZTMtYWYwNS00NTljLWFiNGQtM2UyNTYyNjAzNDYy/edit?hl=en

I've also used the slides from lecture 2,4. 

Everything is in the same class SimpleScene, including nestled objects. 

Controlls
===========
Spawn objects by clicking+1,2,3,4. 
Move/add lightsource with clicking+5. 
Select next object with arrows left and right. 
Move selected object in z-axis with + and -. Speed up by pressing ctrl. 
Move object with clicking+draging+space. 
Reshape object with clicking+draging+shift. 
Rotate object with clicking+draging+r. 
Load in objects with ctrl+v with valid string in clipboard. 
Save all objects to clipboard by ctrl+c. 
Cut selected object with ctrl+x. 
Delete all objects with ctrl+d.
